# 🕵️ Fraud Detection ML Project
Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning in Python (94% Accuracy)

---

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **fraud detection system** using Python and Machine Learning.  
It covers **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation** on real-world financial transaction data.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Preprocessing of **imbalanced datasets**  
- ✅ Implementation of **multiple ML models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- ✅ Performance evaluation with **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC**  
- ✅ Interactive **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis  
- ✅ Clean and modular codebase (`src/` folder)  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9+**
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Streamlit** (for visualization & deployment)

---

## 📈 Results
- Random Forest Accuracy: **98.7%**  
- XGBoost AUC: **0.99**  
- Achieved overall detection accuracy of **94%**  

📊 Example Outputs:  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC Curve  
- Sample Streamlit output (see `Streamlit output 1.pdf` & `Streamlit output 2.pdf`)
